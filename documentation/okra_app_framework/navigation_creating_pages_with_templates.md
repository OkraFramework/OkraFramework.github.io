Creating pages with the Visual Studio templates
===============================================

The Okra App Framework includes a Visual Studio extension that provides a number of item templates for creating typical Windows Store
application pages. Once you have [downloaded and installed the extension](getting_started_downloading.html) you can select Okra App
Framework specific MVVM templates from the Visual Studio **Add New Item** dialog. These match the default Windows Store item templates
but include the "(MVVM)" suffix and fully implement the MVVM pattern.

The provided item templates include,

* **Basic Page (MVVM):** A minimal page with layout awareness, a title, and a back button control
* **Split Page (MVVM):** A page that displays a list of items and the details for a selected item
* **Items Page (MVVM):** A page that displays a collection of items
* **Item Detail Page (MVVM):** A page that displays one item in detail along with navigation to adjacent items in the same group
* **Grouped Items Page (MVVM):** A page that displays item previews arranged in groups
* **Group Detail Page (MVVM):** A page that displays details for a single group and previews each item in the group
* **Hub Page (MVVM):** A page that displays item previews arranged in groups
* **Search Contract (MVVM):** A page for displaying search results
* **Share Target Contract (MVVM):** An app contract that supports receiving items shared by other apps
* **Settings Flyout (MVVM):** A blank Settings Flyout
