Okra App Framework for Windows Phone 8.1
----------------------------------------

Following on from the recent [v1.0 release of the Okra App Framework](http://okraframework.github.io/blog/2015/04/09/okra_v1_0.html),
preview support for Windows Phone 8.1 is now available. This will be wrapped up in an upcoming v1.1 release,
but as of today a beta release is downloadable via NuGet (turn on support for preview versions and look for the
v1.1.0-beta001 package).

This package includes,

* Windows Phone 8.1 support - Simply add a new Windows Phone 8.1 project and reference the NuGet package.
The programming model is the same as for Windows 8.1, and most of your code should be sharable between projects.
* Portable Class Library support - In addition a PCL version is included, which allows sharing of logic and
view-models in a single portable binary between Windows and Windows Phone projects.

Get in touch with any bugs or comments via the
[Okra.Core issue tracker](https://github.com/OkraFramework/Okra.Core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen).


Okra App Framework for Windows 10
---------------------------------

In addition to the beta relase, progress is going well on a Windows 10 port of the Okra App
Framework. Whilst this is not currently available via NuGet, you can check out and build
the code via the [Okra.Core/win-10 branch](https://github.com/OkraFramework/Okra.Core/tree/win-10).
