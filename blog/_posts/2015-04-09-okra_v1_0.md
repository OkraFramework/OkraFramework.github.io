I am really happy to announce that version 1.0 of the Okra App Framework has officially been released. For
those new to the framework, it is an MVVM framework designed from the ground up to be great for creating
Windows apps. Dependency injection is baked in to allow you to create easy to maintain, test and reuse code.
A number of advanced features allow simple integration with application settings, app-to-app sharing and
search. In addition a full set of Visual Studio templates is available to get you started with MVVM
development.

For more information checkout the [Okra Framework website](http://okraframework.github.io).

You can get the Okra App Framework now by installing the Visual Studio extension, from NuGet or GitHub. Full
details on how to download the framework are available [here](http://okraframework.github.io/documentation/okra_app_framework/getting_started_downloading.html).

In addition to the release of the framework we have,

* [A new blog for all the latest news and updates on the framework](http://okraframework.github.io/blog)
* [Documentation covering everything from download instructions to advanced navigation scenarios](http://okraframework.github.io/documentation)
* [Updated sample projects](http://okraframework.github.io/samples)
* [A new end-to-end application sample, Okra-Todo](https://github.com/OkraFramework/Okra-Todo)

Changes from v0.9.8
-------------------

* [Settings panes can now derive from SettingsFlyout](https://github.com/OkraFramework/Okra.Core/issues/57) -
This allows you to use the full Visual Studio designer experience for the settings pane UI
* The Visual Studio settings pane template now derives from SettingsFlyout by default
* All classes/methods/properties/events marked as obsolete in v0.9.8 have been removed for the v1.0 release
* [A number of other minor bug fixes](https://github.com/OkraFramework/Okra.Core/issues?q=milestone%3Av1.0.0+is%3Aclosed)

Okra App Framework vNext
------------------------

The next step for the Okra App Framework v1.1 is to support other platforms, in particular Windows Phone 8.1 and
preview support for Windows 10. Much of the development on these features is already complete so expect to see
a beta release in the near future. You can check out progress and submit bugs and feature requests on the
[Okra.Core issue tracker](https://github.com/OkraFramework/Okra.Core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen). For more
information on feature progress on the v1.1 release you can look at the
[v1.1.0 milestone progress page](https://github.com/OkraFramework/Okra.Core/milestones/v1.1.0).
